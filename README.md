# Second Brain
An Electron based productivity application made for easily clearing your mind, while not letting go of your current task.

Store thoughts, ideas and sidetracks in a hidden to-do list as they appear, without interrupting what you're currently engaged in. Your second brain is just one keyboard shortcut away.

## Shortcuts and interface

- **Ctrl/Cmd+alt+I** : Insert new thought

The field pops up in the foreground and is automatically focused, press enter to save the thought.
